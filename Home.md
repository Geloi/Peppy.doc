### What is Peppy?
Peppy is the name of the application which was written in **P**ython language using **P**ygame library for **P**laying audio files and streams. It provides Graphical User Interface for audio players running in a headless mode.

As Peppy was written in Python it is a cross-platform application. It can run on any platform which supports Python. So far it was tested on Windows and Linux platforms. The availability of Pygame library on a platform is another criteria for running Peppy on that platform. And finally audio player supported by Peppy should be available on that platform as well.
