### What is Peppy?
**Peppy** is the name of the audio player which contains three ingredients: Hardware, Software and Woodware. Why Peppy? This is the first word which came to my mind when I tried to find out any word which would contain three **P** characters for **P**ython **P**ygame **P**layer. That reflects the fact that the software component was written in Python language using Pygame library.

Here are the key features of the Hardware component:
* It is based on popular single-board computer Raspberry Pi 2. This is the "heart".
* High quality audio achieved by using integrated DAC-Amplifier module HiFiBerry Amp+ and Sony speakers. This is the "voice".
* The Hardware have six "senses" to control its functionality:
    * Mouse
    * Keyboard
    * Touch-Screen
    * Infrared Remote Control
    * Rotary Encoders
    * Any computer in a local network or mobile device with Web Browser

Here are the key features of the Software component which represents the "brain":
* This is application written in Python. The cross-platform nature of Python allows to run Peppy on different platforms. It works fine on Windows and Linux.
* Peppy provides Graphical User Interface for audio players running in a headless mode. Currently Peppy supports only 'Mpd' audio player but it was designed in such a way that integrating with new player (e.g. Mplayer) should be pretty simple task.
* Embedded Web Server allows to control audio playback from any Web Browser. It was tested with Firefox, IE, Chrome and Safari. The GUI was written in such a way that it has the same look and feel on Touch-Screen and in Web Browser.
* The default screen resolution is 480*320. This is the resolution of the TFT used for this project. Though UI is dynamic and can scale to any screen resolution.
* Currently Peppy has only Internet Radio functionality. In the future releases support for playing audio files and streams will be implemented.
* By default Peppy has radio profiles for English, French, German and Russian languages. Users can easily add their own stations to playlists.

And finally the key features of the Woodware component:
* Original custom design.
* Made mostly of wood (Cherry and Walnut) with acrylic front and back panels.
* Natural finish - the variation of French Polish.

### Screenshots
To give you the idea how Peppy GUI looks like here are several screenshots of the Peppy player.

###Enjoy!
I hope that the information presented here will be useful for DIY kind of developers. At least such tutorial could save me a lot of time and hair if I would have it when I started this project ;)
