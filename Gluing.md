The gluing process usually requires just two things: wood glue and clamps. It's not recommended to install clamps directly on the pieces which your are gluing. That's because clamps can leave dents. And probably the only way to get rid of those dents is to sand the whole surface down until dents disappear.

To avoids dents from clamps it's recommended to use some spare boards and insert them between clamps and wood. Even in this case don't over-tighten the clamps as you can get dents from insertion boards instead.
