[Adafruit PiTFT Touchscreen](https://www.adafruit.com/products/2097) is the main control component in Peppy player. Even if you are using another controlling devices such as mouse, keyboard or IR remote control you still have to validate the correctness of issued commands on PiTFT. The size of PiTFT is 3.5" and screen resolution is 480*320 pixels. This is probably the minimum touchscreen size/resolution for UI of average complexity like in Peppy player. The touch areas of smaller size screens become hard to use by fingers.
