Sanding accomplishes three tasks: 
1. Remove excess dried glue
2. Adjust the case dimensions to the designed size
3. Makes the surface smooth so that it will be ready for the final finishing process.

The traces of the wood glue are inevitable no matter how carefully you wipe out excess wood glue. The best way to get rid of that glue is to sand it from the surface. The oscillating spindle sander works great on the curved surfaces but is not so good on straight surfaces.
