The following images shows the tools which were used while making Peppy player hardware. The images just give you the idea what you will need if you will decide to work on the similar project. You can definitely use any other tools which you have in your disposal.

### Mechanical Tools

1. [Pliers](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007HGNRQ4). This tools is handy either when you need much stronger fingers for example to tighten nuts or whenever you need much longer fingers - when you have to reach a place not reachable by your fingers.

2. [Phillips Screwdriver](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000XDNSQ2). This tool is to handle large screws with phillips head. Such screws were used to attach speakers, passive radiators, front and back panels.

3. [Tweezers](http://www.amazon.com/Woodstock-D3288-Tweezer-Set-6-Piece/dp/B001N1FR3A). There are many situation when you need tweezers. The most common situation is when you need to hold very small screws, bolts and nuts. Another typical case is to protect your fingers when you hold the component which you are soldering.

4. [Hobby Knife](http://www.amazon.com/Xacto-X5282-Basic-Knife-Set/dp/B00004Z2UB). This tool is very helpful to remove cable plastic insulation.

5. [Small Flat Head Screwdriver](http://www.amazon.com/Stanley-66-039-Jewelers-Precision-Screwdriver/dp/B00002X29G). To tighten the screws on the Amp+ connector you need this tool.

6. [Small Phillips Head Screwdriver](http://www.amazon.com/Stanley-66-039-Jewelers-Precision-Screwdriver/dp/B00002X29G). Almost all hardware components in Peppy player were mounted using this screwdriver which can handle small (2-3 mm) screws with Phillips head.

7. Hexagonal Spanner. This tools is required to tighten screws in the aluminum knobs attached to the rotary encoders.

8. Wire Cutters. This is a must-have tool for any electronic project. It's used to cut wires and to shorten pins of the electronic components.

### Electrical tools.

There are two main electrical tools which I needed to assemble the hardware part of the Peppy player:

1. [Soldering Iron](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000AS28UC). The iron is mostly necessary to prepare GPIO cable which connects infrared sensor and rotary encoders. 

2. [Multimeter](http://www.ebay.com/itm/LCD-Display-Digital-Ammeter-Voltmeter-Ohmmeter-Capacimeter-Multitester-w-Lead-/321883656749). This tool is used to define DC polarity, to make sure that voltage from power supply is correct and to find out the proper wires either in the cables or connectors.
