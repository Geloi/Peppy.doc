Any design starts from sketches and finishes with ready-to-use plans, diagrams or images.

* Expose nice wood grain as much as possible. 
* Keep the case weight in the reasonable range. Solid wood is pretty heavy comparing to

* Make the case easy to assemble. Joining
* Make it transportable. Though it's 
* All parts of the case should be easily accessible to apply finish.
