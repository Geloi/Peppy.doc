It's difficult to process boards with 2" thickness on the regular scroll saw. Therefore I decided to saw multiple thin boards and glue them together. This process is much longer but you have much better control on wood and the result looks is pretty good. The boards had size 24"*6"1/4". This is more than my 21" scroll saw can handle. As the length of the player is 21" I had to cut to this size as the first step.

The wooden case for the Peppy player consists of 7 parts: the central frame (cherry), 2 cylindrical parts for speakers (walnut), 2 cylindrical parts for passive radiators (walnut) and two central parts for hardware (walnut). Each part is about 2" thick therefore it needs a stack of 8 layers of wood. All these parts after sawing and gluing are shown below.

When I was sawing the 1/4" boards I tried to saw about 1-2 mm out of marking lines. That margin allowed to compensate all drawback which can happen during sawing and gluing process. That excess wood can be removed during sanding process when I sanded the pieces to the marking lines. As the case was constructed from several pieces that allowed to work separately on individual pieces. That's much easier than handling the case as one big piece. Only when parts were adjusted to the proper sizes I glued them together.
