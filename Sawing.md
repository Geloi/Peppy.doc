It's difficult to process boards with 2" thickness on the regular scroll saw. Therefore I decided to saw multiple thin boards and [glue](https://github.com/project-owner/Peppy.doc/wiki/Gluing) them together. This process is much longer but you have much better control on wood and the result looks pretty good. The boards had size 24"*6"1/4". This is more than my 21" scroll saw can handle. As the length of the player is 21" I had to cut to this size as the first step.

The wooden case for the Peppy player consists of 7 parts: the central frame (cherry), 2 cylindrical parts for speakers (walnut), 2 cylindrical parts for passive radiators (walnut) and two central parts for hardware (walnut). Each part is about 2" thick therefore it needs a stack of 8 layers of wood. So totally I had to prepare 8*7=56 parts. The following image shows all wooden parts after sawing and gluing.

When I was sawing the 1/4" boards I tried to saw about 1-2 mm out of marking lines. That margin allowed me to compensate all drawback which can always happen during the sawing and gluing processes. That excess wood was removed during the sanding process when I sanded the pieces to the marking lines. As the case was constructed from several pieces that allowed to work separately on individual pieces. That's much easier than handling the case as one big piece. Only when all parts were adjusted to the proper sizes I glued them together.
