###Raspbian###
The Raspbian OS can be installed on SD flash card from several different locations:

1. [Official Raspbian Web Site](https://www.raspbian.org/).
2. [HiFiBerry installer](https://www.hifiberry.com/guides/hifiberry-installer/). It can install many different distributions including Raspbian.
3. [Adafruit Web Site](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-pitft-3-dot-5-touch-screen-for-raspberry-pi/easy-install).

I used the Raspbian from the Adafruit Web Site as it has in that distribution all required configuration settings for the PiTFT touchscreen which I bought from the same web site. If I would use the distribution from another place I would need to make all these changes for touchscreen myself. I used Raspbian Jessie version from September 24 2015.
Free software [Win32 Disk Imager](https://sourceforge.net/projects/win32diskimager/) can be used to install Raspbian image on SD flash card. I used 8GB SD flash card.
