There is separate playlist for each genre and for each language. They contain direct links to the free radio station streams. For example here is the path to English/USA playlist with radio stations for kids:
```
/home/pi/Peppy/stations/en_us/children/children.m3u
```
Here is the example of content from that file:
```
#0
#Kids Public Radio. Lullaby
http://kidspublicradio2.got.net:8000/lullaby
#1
#Kids Public Radio. Pipsqueaks
http://kidspublicradio2.got.net:8000/pipsqueaks
```
The number after the comment character defines the order of the radio station in the station menu in the Station Screen. The station logo image which is located in the same folder as playlist file should be named by this number. For example for the example above there are two images for those stations:
```
/home/pi/Peppy/stations/en_us/children/0.png
/home/pi/Peppy/stations/en_us/children/1.png
```
The image size for station logo should be 200*200 pixels.
