[HiFiBerry Amp+](https://www.hifiberry.com/ampplus/) is the integrated amplifier module - instead of using those traditional components for digital audio system: DAC - Pre-Amp - Power-Amp you can use just one - Amp+. It has Class-D amplifier on board which provides high quality powerful output - 25W on 4 Ohm speakers. This is also very efficient amplifier - with average usage there is no need to use heat sink or fan.
